                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <p>
                    Sea turtles are a very important member of a complex <a
                        href="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Why_Healthy_Oceans_Need_Sea_Turtles.pdf"
                        target="_blank">eco-system</a>. Some are considered the
                    gardeners of the ocean, eating kelp and other plants preventing them from spreading too far.
                    Others keep coral reefs healthy by maintaining levels of sponges. Most species are important to
                    human populations as a source of eco-tourism, as most people (such as you, reader) are curious
                    about these pre-historic animals.
                    Hatchling turtles emerge from a nest with there 100 or so siblings, and scramble towards the water.
                    They face threats all around from the second they are alive. Nests are threatened by human poachers
                    and wild animals. When they emerge from the nest there are many predtators - birds in the sky,
                    foxes, coyotes and dogs on land, and many predators in the ocean. 1 in every 1000 will make it to
                    adulthood.
                    Males spend all their lives in the water, with the rare exception of those that go onto the beach to
                    sunbathe, or get dragged onto the shore on the back of a female. Females themselves only leave the
                    water
                    to build a nest. She'll nest 3-5 times a season, laying 100 or so eggs each time.
                    These fascinating creatures are a joy to observe, and it is up to us to fight for their protection.

                    <p>
                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong>
                        Endangered <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Warm waters across the globe, with the largest colonies off the Eastern coast of Australia
                        and Costa Rica <br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        These turtles don't get their name from their skin or shell, but from their green
                        coloured fat. Large, tear shaped shell. 4 feet long and weighs 140kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Hunting, over exploitation of their eggs, loss of nesting beaches, climate change and
                        accidental bycatch by
                        the fishing industry <br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        They're the only herbivorous sea turtle and it's thought their diet contributes to the green
                        fat layer they have.<br>

                        Vulnerable <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Spend a lot of their life drifting thousands of kilometers through temperate and tropical
                        oceans. Two largest nesting areas for these turtles are the SE coast of the US and the coast
                        of Oman. <br>
                        <strong>Distinguising features:</strong>

                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>

                        Vulnerable (with criticaly endangered subpopulations) <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        This turtle has the widest rangee of all turtles, appearing in all but the polar oceans. Now the 
                        largest nesting populations exist in Gabon (Africa), West Indes and Indonesia.<br>
                        <strong>Distinguising features:</strong>
                        They don't have a hard shell, but a softer leather-like one. They can grow over 6 feet long.
                        They are typically adorned with light spots and they have 7 ridges running down their back.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Egg exploitation and fishery bycatch. Their main diet is jellyfish which makes them 
                        particularly susceptible to plastic ingestion related death.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        This is the largest of all sea turtles, and can weigh up to 500kg! They will travel
                        across oceans to find their favourite jellyfish to eat. <br>

                        Critically endangered <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        These turtles have a smaller range than others, choosing specific reefs to spend their life.
                        They typically only leave to go to the nesting grounds where they were born. Their coraf reefs are found
                        in tropical opeans across over 100 countries worldwide. <br>
                        <strong>Distinguising features:</strong>
                        Their sharp pointed beak, which allows them to get sponges from coral reefs. They have a bright
                        streaked yellow and brown shell. They grow up to 3 feet long and weigh up to 70kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Illegal trade and bycatch. 
                        Hawksbill turtles are particularly sought after for their beautiful shells for tortoiseshell 
                        jewellery and ornaments.<br>
                        They are also susceptible to entanglement in gillnets and fish hook capture.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Much of the sponges and other food items chosen by a Hawksbill
                        are poisonous, but they're able to safely store this toxin in their fat, making them in turn 
                        toxic to eat.<br>

                        Found globally across the tropical waters of the South Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.
                        They nest on only a few beaches and may do this as part of a group 
                        (<a href="https://youtu.be/0hlKFlgN-PQ" target="_blank">arribada</a> where they synchronously emerge 
                        on a beach to nest) or in the typical fashion of emerging one by one when they're ready within the 
                        nesting season.<br>

                        It's olive green coloured shell - this is where it gets its name from.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Coastal development. They nest only in a small number of beaches, so if these become disturbed
                        or unsuitable to turtle nesting it could really damage the population.
                        Nests are over exploited and they're still hunted for meat and skin.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        This is one of the smallest but most abundant of all sea turtles, Only grow to 2 and a half feet long

                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
