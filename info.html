                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <p>
                    Sea turtles are a very important member of a complex <a
                        href="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Why_Healthy_Oceans_Need_Sea_Turtles.pdf"
                        target="_blank">eco-system</a>. Some are considered the
                    gardeners of the ocean, eating kelp and other plants preventing them from spreading too far.
                    Others keep coral reefs healthy by maintaining levels of sponges. Most species are important to
                    human populations as a source of eco-tourism, as most people (such as you, reader) are curious
                    about these pre-historic animals. <br>
                    Hatchling turtles emerge from a nest with thier 100 or so siblings, and scramble towards the water.
                    They face so many challenges at this young age that only 1 in every 1000 will make it to
                    adulthood.
                    Males spend all their lives in the water, with the rare exception of those that go onto the beach to

                        target="_blank">sunbathe</a>, or get dragged onto the shore on the back of a female. Females
                    themselves only leave the
                    water
                    to build a nest 3-5 times per season.
                    These fascinating creatures are a joy to observe, and it is up to us to clean our oceans protect
                    them.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong>
                        Endangered <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Warm waters across the globe, with the largest colonies off the Eastern coast of Australia
                        and Costa Rica <br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        These turtles don't get their name from their skin or shell, but rather from a thick layer of
                        green
                        coloured fat under their skin. They grow up to 4 feet long and weighs 140kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Hunting and poaching, over exploitation of their eggs, loss of nesting beaches, climate change
                        and
                        accidental bycatch by the fishing industry <br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        They're the only herbivorous sea turtle during adulthood and it's thought this diet contributes
                        to
                        the green fat layer they have.<br> These turtles often look like they're crying while they're
                        nesting,
                        but they're not sad (presumably). It's actually a way for them to excrete excess salt!

                        Vulnerable <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Spend a lot of their life drifting thousands of kilometers through temperate and tropical
                        oceans. Two largest nesting areas for these turtles are the SE coast of the US and the coast
                        of Oman. They might even share nesting beaches with other turtle species, like the Green sea
                        turtle
                        in Norther Cyrpus.<br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>

                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Coastal development, poaching and exploitation, and accidental fishery bycatch. <br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        Their strong head and jaws allow them to eat a varied diet inaccessible to many other animals.
                        This typically includes hard shelled creatures such as horseshoe crabs. <br>

                        Vulnerable (with criticaly endangered subpopulations) <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        This turtle has the widest range of all turtles, appearing in all but the polar oceans. Now the
                        largest nesting populations exist in Gabon (Africa), West Indes and Indonesia.<br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        They don't have a hard shell, but a softer leather-like one. They can grow over 6 feet long.
                        They are typically adorned with light spots.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Egg exploitation and fishery bycatch. Their main diet is jellyfish which makes them
                        particularly susceptible to plastic ingestion related deaths.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        This is the largest of all sea turtles, and can weigh up to 900kg! They will travel
                        across oceans to find their favourite jellyfish to eat. <br>

                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        These turtles have a smaller range than others, choosing specific reefs to spend their life.
                        They typically only leave to go to the nesting grounds where they were born. These coral reefs
                        are found in tropical waters worldwide. <br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        Their sharp pointed beak, which allows them to eat sponges from coral reefs. They have a bright
                        streaked yellow and brown shell. They grow up to 3 feet long and weigh up to 70kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Illegal trade and bycatch.
                        Hawksbill turtles are particularly sought after for their beautiful shells for tortoiseshell
                        jewellery and ornaments.<br>
                        They are also susceptible to entanglement in gillnets and fish hook capture.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Much of the sponges and other food items chosen by a Hawksbill
                        are poisonous, but they're able to safely store this toxin in their fat, making them in turn
                        toxic to eat.<br>

                        It's olive green coloured shell - this is where it gets its name from. They are one of the
                        smallest sea turtles, only growing to 2 and a half feet long and weigh up to 50kg. <br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Coastal development. They nest only in a small number of beaches, so if these become disturbed
                        or unsuitable to turtle nesting it could really damage the population.
                        Nests are over exploited and they're still hunted for meat and skin.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        Turtles usually nest in isolation, in their own time during the season. These may turtles may
                        do this, or nest synchronously as part of a group in a phenomenon known as

                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        It has a very round, almost circular shell in contrast to the typical tear drop shape.
                        They are the smallest sea turtle species. They can grow to just over 2 feet and weigh 45kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        This turtle is very susceptible to coastal development. Their nesting is concentrated in a
                        singular area, which means if they lose this nesting space, or is becomes unsuitable, the
                        population could easily suffer critical declines. On top of this, they're still largely under
                        threat by predation, accidental bycatch and global warming.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        Nearly 95% of nesting worldwide happens in Mexico, at the same time in the arribaba fashion.
                        They're the only sea turtle to commonly nest during the day <br>

                    <h2>Flatback sea turtle <em>Natator depressus</em></h2><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong>
                        DD (Data Deficient) <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Only found around the Australian and Papua New Guinea coastlines. <br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        As the name suggests, it's shell is much, much flatter than other turtle species. They can
                        grow just over 3 feet long and weight up to 90kg. <br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Coastal development, over exploitation and coral reef loss. Australian coral reefs are under
                        considerable stress, like other reefs all over the world, but the scarcity of this turtle
                        emphasizes the need for their protection.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        Despite having a strong carapace, they are predated upon by crocodiles during the nesting
                        season! Australia also considers them to be vulnerable, but the IUCN classes them as DD. This
                        is probably because of the relative remoteness of the species. <br>
