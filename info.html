                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <p>
                    Sea turtles are a very important member of a complex <a
                    href="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Why_Healthy_Oceans_Need_Sea_Turtles.pdf"
                    target="_blank">eco-system</a>. They're not only important for maintaining the eco-system's health, but they
                    benefit local human communities as a source of eco-tourism, as many people (such as you, reader) are curious
                    about these pre-historic animals. <br>
                    Only<a href="https://www.seeturtles.org/baby-turtles" target="_blank"> 1 in every 1000</a> hatchlings 
                    will make it to adulthood. Sea turtles spend all their lives in the water, except for females who go onto beaches to 
                    lay nests, and the rare exceptions of those that
                    <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2011/01/10/hawaii-news/ocean-watch/basking-in-the-sun-makes-our-green-sea-turtles-unique/"
                        target="_blank">sunbathe</a> or get dragged onto the shore on the back of a female. These turtles face low odds of 
                        surviving to adulthood, and we need to do all we can to help them do this.<br>
                    <strong>Despite being protected sea turtles face many dangers</strong>. Hunting, poaching and 
                    over-exploitation of nests are real threats to all species of turtle. The Hawksbill in particular is
                    vulnerable to hunting as their shell is used in <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/endangered-hawksbill-turtle-shell-trade-is-bigger-than-scientists-realized"
                     target="_blank">tortoiseshell trade</a>. Turtles are vulnerable to getting 
                    caught in <a href="https://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/sea_turtle_bycatch_factsheet_032917_online.pdf" target="_blank">
                    fishing nets and lines</a>, and even if released they may be too injured to survive.
                    <a href="https://www.seeturtles.org/coastal-development" target="_blank"> Coastal development</a> is making 
                    nesting beaches unsuitable. Turtles can be discouraged from nesting, more people and dogs can cause nests to be disturbed 
                    more frequently and bright lights can disorientate the hatchlings who come out at night. Species like the 
                    <a href="https://www.nps.gov/pais/learn/nature/kempsridleystory.htm" target="_blank">Kemp's ridley</a> 
                    only nest in a small few locations, so losing even one beach could cause a rapid decline in populations. Plastic pollution 
                    is a serious threat to sea turtles. <a href="https://oceanblueproject.org/sea-turtle-facts/" target="_blank">Plastic</a> 
                    causes many problems for turtles, and when it's floating in 
                    the water it's often mistaken for food causing turtles to choke. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2879/climate-change-puts-pressure-on-sea-turtles/#:~:text=Now%2C%20climate%20change%20is%20exposing,of%20them%20need%20to%20survive."
                    target="_blank">Climate change</a> could topple the stability of 
                    populations as sex is determined by the temperature of the nest. <strong>These dangers only exist because of people, so 
                    it's up to us to now undo some of that damage.</strong>

                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong><br>
                        These turtles have a thick layer of green coloured fat under their skin, which is where their name comes from.
                        This most likely is caused by their herbivorous diet! They grow up to 4 feet long and weigh 140kg.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong><br>
                        These turtles often look like they're crying while they're nesting, but they're not sad (presumably). 
                        It's actually a way for them to excrete excess salt.<br>

                    <h2>Kemp's Ridley sea turtle <br> <em>(Lepidochelys kempii)</em></h2><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong><br>
                        Critically endangered<br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong><br>
                        The Gulf of Mexico and along the eastern coast of the US<br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong><br>
                        It has a very round, almost circular shell in contrast to the typical tear drop shape.
                        They're the smallest sea turtle, growing just over 2 feet and weighing 45kg.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong><br>
                        95% of their nesting happens in Mexico at the same time (arribaba). This way of nesting
                        increases the risk of a nest being disturbed while another is being built.
                        They're the only sea turtle to commonly nest during the day. <br>

                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong><br>
                        Data Deficient <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong><br>
                        Only Australia and Papua New Guinea coastlines.<br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong><br>
                        As the name suggests, it has a much flatter shell than other turtle species.<br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong><br>
                        Despite having a strong carapace, they are predated upon by crocodiles during the nesting
                        season! Australia also considers them to be vulnerable, but the IUCN classes them as DD. <br>
