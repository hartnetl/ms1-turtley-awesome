                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <p>
                    Sea turtles are a very important member of a complex <a
                        href="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Why_Healthy_Oceans_Need_Sea_Turtles.pdf"
                        target="_blank">eco-system</a>. Some are considered the
                    gardeners of the ocean, eating kelp and other plants preventing them from spreading too far.
                    Others keep coral reefs healthy by maintaining levels of sponges. Most species are important to
                    human populations as a source of eco-tourism, as most people (such as you, reader) are curious
                    about these pre-historic animals.
                    Hatchling turtles emerge from a nest with there 100 or so siblings, and scramble towards the water.
                    They face threats all around from the second they are alive. Nests are threatened by human poachers
                    and wild animals. When they emerge from the nest there are many predtators - birds in the sky,
                    foxes, coyotes and dogs on land, and many predators in the ocean. 1 in every 1000 will make it to
                    adulthood.
                    Males spend all their lives in the water, with the rare exception of those that go onto the beach to
                    sunbathe, or get dragged onto the shore on the back of a female. Females themselves only leave the
                    water
                    to build a nest. She'll nest 3-5 times a season, laying 100 or so eggs each time.
                    These fascinating creatures are a joy to observe, and it is up to us to fight for their protection.

                    <h2>Green sea turtle <em>(Chelonia mydas)</em></h2><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong>
                        Endangered <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Warm waters across the globe, with the largest colonies off the Eastern coast of Australia
                        and Costa Rica <br>
                        <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong>
                        These turtles don't get their name from their skin or shell, but from their green
                        coloured fat. Large, tear shaped shell. 4 feet long and weighs 140kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Hunting, over exploitation of their eggs, loss of nesting beaches, climate change and
                        accidental bycatch by
                        the fishing industry <br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        They're the only herbivorous sea turtle and it's thought their diet contributes to the green
                        fat layer they have.<br>

                        <strong>IUCN status:</strong>
                        Vulnerable <br>
                        <strong>Location:</strong>
                        Spend a lot of their life drifting thousands of kilometers through temperate and tropical
                        oceans. Two largest nesting areas for these turtles are the SE coast of the US and the coast 
                        of Oman. <br>
                        <strong>Distinguising features:</strong>
                        Their big broad head. They grow up to 3 feet long and weight up to 113kg.<br>
                        <strong>Biggest threats:</strong>
                        Coastal development and bycatch. <br>
                        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
                        Their stong head and jaws allow them to eat a varied diet which includes horseshoe crabs
                        and other hard shelled creatures. <br>
