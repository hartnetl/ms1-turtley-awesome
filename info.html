                <p> 
                    Sea turtles are a very important member of a complex <a
                    href="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Why_Healthy_Oceans_Need_Sea_Turtles.pdf"
                    target="_blank">eco-system</a>. Some are considered the 
                    gardeners of the ocean, eating kelp and other plants preventing them from spreading too far. 
                    Others keep coral reefs healthy by maintaining levels of sponges. Most species are important to
                    human populations as a source of eco-tourism, as most people (such as you, reader) are curious
                    about these pre-historic animals.
                    Hatchling turtles emerge from a nest with there 100 or so siblings, and scramble towards the water.
                    They face threats all around from the second they are alive. Nests are threatened by human poachers 
                    and wild animals. When they emerge from the nest there are many predtators - birds in the sky, 
                    foxes, coyotes and dogs on land, and many predators in the ocean. 1 in every 1000 will make it to adulthood.
                    Males spend all their lives in the water, with the rare exception of those that go onto the beach to
                    sunbathe, or get dragged onto the shore on the back of a female. Females themselves only leave the water
                    to build a nest. She'll nest 3-5 times a season, laying 100 or so eggs each time.
                    These fascinating creatures are a joy to observe, and it is up to us to fight for their protection.
