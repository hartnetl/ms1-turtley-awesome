                <p>
                    If you've made it this far, I'm assuming you know who we are and what we're about. But if not,
                    let me tell you. <br>
                    This is a website dedicated to raising awareness for Sea Turtle conservation. Of the 7 species of
                    sea
                    turtle on Earth, six are classified as endangered. The seventh isn't even classified. These animals
                    are faced with man made threats every day, from fishing nets to climate change, these beautiful
                    animals are at risk. But they don't have to be. <br>
                    If everyone pledged to make small changes, we could drastically improve the health of our oceans and
                    give not only these animals, but every animal, a better chance at survival. So why not start today?

                <p>
                    Sea turtles have been around for millions of years. 120 million to be (relatively) precise, which means
                    they were swimming around while dinosaurs roamed the earth. They haven't changed too much since then,
                    and even after surviving those millions of years, their populations have been deciemated in recent
                    times.
                    Even though hunting sea turtles is largely illegal now, huge fishing trawlers deplete the oceans of
                    turtles' prey, or accidentally catch the turtles themselves. A high percentage of those relaeased
                    still die.
                    As global temperatures rise, the balance of male to female sea turtles is shifting out of balance,
                    as sex is determined by nest temperatures. As coastal areas are developed, nesting beaches become
                    unsuitable for turtles to lay in, and even if they can, hatchlings which typically emerge at night
                    are easily disoriented by the bright lights, as they navigate by the moon.
                    But hope is not lost. By making a few small changes in our day to day lives, we can undo the
                    damage we have done to let these animals return to their previous abundance.
                    Turtle sex is determined by the temperature of the nest - cooler nests produce males, warmer females.
                    Plastic pollution is a leading cause of turtle death.
