                <p>
                    If you've made it this far, I'm assuming you know who we are and what we're about. But if not,
                    let me tell you. <br>
                    This is a website dedicated to raising awareness for Sea Turtle conservation. Of the 7 species of
                    sea
                    turtle on Earth, six are classified as endangered. The seventh isn't even classified. These animals
                    are faced with man made threats every day, from fishing nets to climate change, these beautiful
                    animals are at risk. But they don't have to be. <br>
                    If everyone pledged to make small changes, we could drastically improve the health of our oceans and
                    give not only these animals, but every animal, a better chance at survival. So why not start today?
