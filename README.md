# Milestone 1: Turtley Awesome 

## Introduction 

***

Overview of project. What this project hopes to accomplish, who it's intended to target and how it will be useful to target audience.

Welcome to Turtley Awesome, a site designed to deliver up to date and comprehensive information on the conservation of sea turtles.
I chose this project as it is imporant to me personally. It's a cause I've always believed in. I've loved turtles since I was a kid and this never went away. In 2016 I went to Cyprus to volunteer with SPOT, a conservation programme for Green Sea Turtles and Loggerheads. I learned a lot during this time, and hope to share some of this knowledge. 

This site is intended for people with an interest in turtles conservation and making eco-friendly choices. This site will provide a place for people to come and learn about the types of sea turtles, have a place for turtle/eco-friendly events and share tips for living a more eco-friendly life.
