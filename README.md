# Milestone 1: Turtley Awesome 

## Introduction 

***

Overview of project. What this project hopes to accomplish, who it's intended to target and how it will be useful to target audience.

Welcome to Turtley Awesome, a site designed to deliver up to date and comprehensive information on the conservation of sea turtles.
I chose this project as it is imporant to me personally. Animal conservation is a subject I care deeply about and it's a cause I've always believed in. I've loved turtles since I was a kid and this never went away. In 2016 I went to Cyprus to volunteer with SPOT, a conservation programme for Green Sea Turtles and Loggerheads. I learned a lot during this time, and this site seemed like a good 
opportunity to share this info with people who might not know anything about turtles. I hope to provide some basic understanding of the severity of humanaty's impact on the planet, and by supplying ample links to more information, get people interested and involved.
If even one person changes their behaviour I would call this website a success.

This site will provide a place for people to come and learn about the types of sea turtles, have a place for turtle/eco-friendly events and share tips for living a more eco-friendly life.

## Overview of site 

*** 

Page 1: index.html
An introduction to the website, Turtley Awesome, which is a site aimed at raising awareness to turtle 
conservation. It will have a general introduction, a brief overveiw on conservation, an events/webinars 
section and a form to subscrible to the newsletter at the bottom.
In the footer, each social media link leads to the related social media home page. The left turtle icon will
lead to a surprise page with a turtle hatching video. The right side turtle icon will lead to a page with a game
on it - currently not related to turtle conservation because Flash lost support and that's what a lot of games used.
So a clone version of Flappy Bird is there instead.

Page 2: info.html
The second page will contain general sea turtle information and an explanation of the IUCN red list classifications. The main content will be information on the 7 types of sea turtles, accompanied by a picture of each as the background. A sticky side navigation bar will be included as an aside to direct you to each of the turtle types on desktop and tablet. This disappears on the mobile version and a simpler navigation appears at the top instead.

Page 3: help.html
Information on how individuals can contribute to the protection and conservation of sea turtles and live a more eco-friendly life.
After this section will be a shop section for eco-friendly items to be advertised.
There will be a section for donations - icons which link to the websites for direct donations.

Page 4: contact.html
This page will just have a contact us section. It will require a name and e-mail to be taken. Drop down bar for:
general enquiry, feedback and technical issues. Placeholder text will be entered into the text box area.

External page 1
The bottom left turtle will be clickable. It will lead to a page that has a video of baby turtles. 
Open in new tab - no navigation. 

External page 2
The bottom right turtle will be clickable and leads to a new page with a game. This would have been a turtle game if flash was still supported.
